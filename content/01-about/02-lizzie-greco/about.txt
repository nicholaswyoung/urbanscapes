Lizzie Greco started (link: http://www.craftbelly.com text: Craftbelly) as an outlet for her to work with her hands, using her favorite material: handmade, decorative paper, and grew into something bigger when she realized she could share this beauty with others.

She is delighted by the way the unique patterns and color schemes add spirit and personality to her favorite photos. The frame becomes more than just a way to display the photo or art; it enhances the entire experience.
